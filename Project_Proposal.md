## Extreme sports shop and comparison:
### Project Summary:
##### Topic:
Our topic is extreme sports. We will describe some of the most widely known sports and compare them. The comparison will contain the environment where you can do the sport best and the different risks.
#### General:
The page includes an online shop where you can buy essential equipment for extreme sports for every season. You can buy and get information on sports gear. There will be a home page where the current sales and newest products will be displayed. There will also be a list of different categories and a filter for the different products.
#### Offers:
There will be a field of options for different sports. Snowboarding and skiing for winter and bmxing, skateboarding and cave diving for summer. You can also buy clothing and shoes from the most popular brands of the sports.
#### Purchasing:
If you want to purchase a product, you will have to log in or register with a username, a password and your address. Then you can add it add to your shopping cart and you will be able to check-out and buy the product.
#### Information:
You can get information on every product. If you click on it, it shows the brand and the specialties of it.
### Project Timeframe:
One school year (year 2019/20)
### Prepared by SCHWEIGER Johannes and SEIFERT Moritz
### Project Contact:
KLEWEIN David
### Why are you doing this project:
We do the project in the Web Technology subbject in our school.
### What will you be doing:
Currently we are working on the login/register feature. Afterwards we will work on the shopping cart.
### How will you be doing it:
We work with a JSON API and JavaScript.
### Who will be doing it:
We will do it together.
### How long will it take:
It will take us about 5 weeks to finish our planned project, but it will take longer if we want to make it perfect.
### Project Methodology:
We am working on the login/register feature with Visual Studio Code. We use the JSON API to save the data for the feature. it is a bit complicated to make the login. For the register feature, we think we'll need about two hours (with CSS and no issues). The login requires more time because it is a bit more code.
We think the shopping cart is not that difficult. We only need to add all prizes of the inserted products. It will take about 5 hours to make it perfect with no issues.
### Conclusion:
I think we have clear plans for the upcoming weeks. We know what to do next and we know how much time it will take. I think this shop will be a easy to use online shop.
